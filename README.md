# ubiquitous-giggle
First, but not last github repo.

# What I hope to learn
I am intersted in learning how I can automate certain tasks at home, work, and in future classes. Python will be useful and forced use of github will allow me to become familiar with what the world uses to share ideas and useful tools.

# Current State
Currently I am not working on any scripting projects, but am taking this class and a building connections class until the end of the semester. Outside of school I work full-time and am applying to a new position in another state that will bring me closer to family and a broader range of employers than what I am currently doing. I strive to improve and juggle the various aspects of life, while making time for myself. 

# Hobby
I enjoy anything outside. Fresh air and sunlight do wonders for our health no matter if you are journaling by the river bank or running on a paved trail.
